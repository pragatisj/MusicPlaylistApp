# MusicPlaylistApp

✅ Project Title:
“Music Playlist Manager App using Java OOP”

🔷 Objective:
To build a console-based music playlist application that allows users to create albums, add songs, and play them like a music player using object-oriented programming in Java.

🔷 Features:
🎵 Add songs to an album
📁 Create multiple albums by different artists
📜 Create custom playlists from album songs
⏯️ Play next, previous, and replay current song
❌ Delete the current song from the playlist
🧾 Show all songs in the current playlist
📘 Menu-based navigation (interactive console)

🔷 Technologies Used:
Java
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Collections Framework
ArrayList for albums and songs
LinkedList & ListIterator for playlist traversal

🔷 Java Concepts Used:
Concept	How it's Used
Class & Object	Song, Album, and Playlist handling
Encapsulation	Using private variables & public methods
Constructor	Initializing songs and albums
ArrayList	Managing a list of songs in an album
LinkedList	Storing and navigating songs in the playlist
ListIterator	To move forward/backward in the playlist
Method Overloading	addToPlaylist() by index or title

🔷 Summary:
This project simulates a real-world music playlist manager using Java. It demonstrates object-oriented design through modular classes like Song, Album, and the use of Java Collections to manage songs dynamically. The playlist can be navigated interactively, allowing real-time song control like a music app.
